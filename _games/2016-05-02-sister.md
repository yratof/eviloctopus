- Jessica & Rebecca are sisters
- They live near a forest
- After a storm, light particles fill the air around the entrance to the forest
- The girls are playing with the light fragments, chasing and catching them
- Before they know they're following the lights deeper into the forest
- Everything starts getting darker
- Suddenly they hit a wall
- The wall's eyes open wide
- The ground starts shaking as the wall emerges from it, slowly forming it's monolithic shape
- The girls start to rise from the ground as the creature stands, both suddenly being separated by two eyes
- The vast creature splits in two and strides away from itself with each sister still on their backs
