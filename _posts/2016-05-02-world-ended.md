When the world ends, there will be nothing left.

Except you.

And some other stuff.

When you emerge from your house, built in a time after the war, you realise that you're one of the unlucky ones that managed to survive the end of the world.
Equiped with what seems to be the leg of your cat, you search for ther misfortunate souls...
