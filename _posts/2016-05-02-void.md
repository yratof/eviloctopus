You and your partner were cut off from the rest of the mining crew.
Limited to just what you find, you’ve got to make your way back through the constellations to reach the depot.
When you get back, only fragments remain – you are now alone in space.

Fight your way through an endless maze of nothingness to find something worth living for.
